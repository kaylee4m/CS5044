///---Use---///
There are two visualization graphs in the ‘index.html’. 

The first one is a line chart and the second one is a bar graph.
=> Three filters can be used to filter the data, including country, subject(education level) and time. 
=> The chart changes as the filter’s selection. 
=> If you don’t choose any country, you can also check the data. 
	-->	Place the mouse over the line and you can see the specific data.

The second visualization shows the proportion of tertiary education in different countries.
=> Select the specific year in the filter. 
=> Place the mouse over the histogram and you can see the specific data.
